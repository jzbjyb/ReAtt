This repository contains the code, models, and data for the paper 
[Retrieval as Attention: End-to-end Learning of Retrieval and Reading within a Single Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.02027.pdf) by Zhengbao Jiang*, Luyu Gao*, Jun Araki, Haibo Ding, Zhiruo Wang, Graham Neubig.

## Overview

ReAtt is a T5-based retrieval-augmented model for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g., QA) that performs retrieval using attention and learns retrieval and reading in a fully end-to-end way only relying on end-task annotations.
